=begin
Create a method that takes two arguments, multiplies them together, and returns the result.

Example:
multiply(5, 3) == 15

=end

def multiply(num1, num2)
   num1 * num2
end


#solution 
#remember when asked return value of a method != output of that method.
#if we wrote puts num1 * num2 then the return value would have been nil as
#the method puts returns nil value
